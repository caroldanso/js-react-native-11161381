# JavaScript for React Native (11161381)

## Task Explanation:

### Task 1:
- Created a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js`.
- Implemented a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2:
- Added a function `formatArrayStrings` in `arrayManipulation.js`.
- The function takes two arrays: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`.
- Modifies each string based on its corresponding number:
  - Capitalizes the entire string if the number is even.
  - Converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3:
- Created a file `userInfo.js`.
- Implemented a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
- Returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Task 4:
- Added a README file.
- Included student ID and a brief explanation of each task.
